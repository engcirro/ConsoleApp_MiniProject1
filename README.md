# ConsoleApp_MiniProject1:Small Asset Management Project 
Asset Tracking is a way to keep track of the company assets, like Laptops, Stationary computers, phones and so on.  In this project, all assets have an end of life which for simplicity reasons is 3 years. 
The fictional company that uses this program has three branches aroud the world namely: USA, Sweden and Japan, so this program accepts only these names as office locations when attempted user to insert location.  When you write the list to the console: Sorted first by office, then Purchase date
Items are marked *RED* if their expiry date is less than 3 months away from 3 years. Items *Yellow* if date less than 6 months away from 3 years. The default currency is SEK and each itemlist will show the exchange rate of the other countries(USA and Japan).
